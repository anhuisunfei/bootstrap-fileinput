The plugin allows you a simple way to setup an advanced file picker/upload control built to work specially with Bootstrap CSS3 styles. It enhances the file input functionality further, by offering support to preview a wide variety of files i.e. images, text, html, video, audio, flash, and objects. In addition, it includes AJAX based uploads, dragging &amp; dropping files, viewing upload progress, and selectively previewing, adding, or deleting files.\r\n![File Input Screenshot](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3FiEmc_okc4/VBw_d2LBAJI/AAAAAAAAAL8/KbVj5X9Dus0/w596-h454-no/FileInput.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis plugin was initially inspired by [this blog article](http://www.abeautifulsite.net/blog/2013/08/whipping-file-inputs-into-shape-with-bootstrap-3/) and [Jasny's File Input plugin](http://jasny.github.io/bootstrap/javascript/#fileinput). But the plugin has now matured with various additional features and enhancements to be a complete (yet simple) file management tool and solution for web developers. \r\n\r\n> NOTE: The latest version of the plugin is v4.2.7 (dev-master). Refer the [CHANGE LOG](https://github.com/kartik-v/bootstrap-fileinput/blob/master/CHANGE.md) for details. \r\n\r\n## Features  \r\n\r\n### File Input Features\r\n\r\n1. The plugin will convert a simple HTML file input to an advanced file picker control. Will help fallback to a normal HTML file input for browsers not supporting JQuery or Javascript.\r\n2. The file input consists of the following three sections with options and templates to control the display:\r\n   - **_file caption section_**: to display a brief information of the file(s) selected\r\n   - **_file action buttons section_**: to browse, remove, and upload files.\r\n   - **_file preview section_**: to display the selected files on client for preview (supports preview of image, text, flash, and video file types). Other file types will be displayed as normal thumbnails.\r\n3. The plugin automatically converts an input with `type = file` to an advanced file picker input if you set its `class = file`. All options to the input can be passed as HTML5 `data` attributes.\r\n4. Ability to select and preview multiple files. Uses HTML 5 File reader API to read and preview files. Displays the progress of files being being loaded onto the preview zone, in case many files are chosen.\r\n5. Offers predefined templates and CSS classes which can be changed to style your file-input display as per your needs.\r\n6. With **v1.5.0**, you can now configure the plugin to show an **initial preview of images/files** with **initial caption** \r\n   (more useful for record update scenarios). Refer the [`initialPreview`](https://github.com/kartik-v/bootstrap-fileinput/blob/master/README.md#initialpreview) \r\n   and [`initialCaption`](https://github.com/kartik-v/bootstrap-fileinput/blob/master/README.md#initialcaption) properties in the plugin options\r\n   section for configuring this.\r\n7. Option to show/hide any or all of the following:\r\n   - caption section\r\n   - preview section\r\n   - upload button\r\n   - remove button\r\n8. Customise the location of the target container elements to display the entire plugin, the caption container, the caption text, the preview container, preview image, and preview status.\r\n9. For text file previews, autowrap the text to the thumbnail width, and show a wrap indicator link to display complete text on hover. You can customize the wrap indicator (which defaults to &hellip;).\r\n10. Customise the messages for preview, progress, and files selected.\r\n11. Upload action defaults to form submit. Supports an upload route/server action parameter for custom ajax based upload.\r\n12. Triggers JQuery events for advanced development. Events currently available are `filereset`, `fileclear`, `filecleared`, `fileloaded`, and `fileerror`.\r\n13. Disabled and readonly file input support.\r\n14. Dynamically auto size the file captions for long file names exceeding container width. \r\n15. Raise new `fileimageuploaded` event that fires after image is completely loaded on the preview container.\r\n16. Autosize preview images when they exceed the size of the preview container.\r\n17. Completely templatized and extensible to allow configuration of the file-input the way the developer wants.\r\n18. Preview intelligence based on various file preview types. The inbuilt file support types are categorized as `image`, `text`, `html`, `video`,  `audio`, `flash`, `object`, and `other`.\r\n19. `allowedPreviewTypes`: You can now configure which all file types are allowed to be shown as a preview. This defaults to `['image', 'html', 'text', 'video', 'audio', 'flash', 'object']`. Thus all file types are treated as an object to preview by default. For exampleTo preview only `image` and `video`, you can set this to `['image', 'video']`.\r\n20. `allowedPreviewMimeTypes`: In addition to `allowedPreviewTypes`, you can also control which all mime types can be displayed for preview. This defaults to null, meaning all mime types are supported.\r\n   >NOTE: With release 2.5.0 you can now control which file types or extensions are allowed for upload by setting `allowedFileTypes` and `allowedFileExtensions`.\r\n21. `layoutTemplates`: Allows you to configure all layout template settings within one property. The layout objects that can be configured are: `main1`, `main2`, `preview`, `caption`, and `modal`.\r\n22. `previewTemplates`: All preview templates for **each preview type** have been combined into one property, instead of separate templates for image, text etc. The keys are the formats as set in `allowedPreviewTypes` and values are the templates used for previewing. There are default prebuilt templates for each preview file type (`generic`, `image`, `text`, `html`, `video`,  `audio`, `flash`, `object`, and `other`). The `generic` template is used only for displaying `initialPreview` content using direct markup.\r\n23. `previewSettings`: Allows you to configure width and height for each preview image type. The plugin has default widths and heights predefined for each type i.e `image`, `text`, `html`, `video`,  `audio`, `flash`, and `object`.\r\n24. `fileTypeSettings`: Allows you to configure and identify each preview file type using a callback. The plugin has default callbacks predefined to identify each type i.e `image`, `text`, `html`, `video`,  `audio`, `flash`, and `object`.\r\n25. Replacing tags within templates has been enhanced. With this release it will automatically check for multiple occurrences of each tag to replace within a template string.\r\n26. Manipulate events and add your own custom validation messages easily by returning output to abort uploads in any of the other events.\r\n27. Support for translations and locales.\r\n\r\n### File Upload Features\r\n\r\nWith release 4.0.0, the plugin now also includes inbuilt support for AJAX Uploads and selectively adding or deleting files. AJAX upload functionality are \r\nbuilt upon HTML5 FormData and XMLHttpRequest Level 2 standards. Most modern browsers do support this standard, but the plugin will automatically degrade to normal form based submission for unsupported browsers.\r\n\r\n1. Add functionality for AJAX based UPLOAD using HTML5 FormData (most modern browsers support it). Will degrade to normal Form Based File submission if this is not supported.\r\n2. To use AJAX Upload, one must set the `uploadUrl` property.\r\n3. Enhance plugin to now allow files to be added, appended, removed (based on FEEDBACK from many). Thus one can append files to preview.\r\n4. New DRAG & DROP zone available in preview to drag and drop files and append.\r\n5. Delete or upload files one by one OR in batch.\r\n6. If `showPreview` is set to false, or uploadUrl is not supported plugin will degrade to normal form based upload.\r\n7. Configurable indicators for file awaiting upload, file successfully uploaded, files errored in upload.\r\n8. Ability to add extra form data with ajax based uploads.\r\n9. Upload progress bar and individual thumbnail upload indicators.\r\n10. Ability to cancel and abort ongoing AJAX uploads.\r\n11. Build up initial preview content (e.g. gallery of saved images). You can set initial preview actions (prebuilt support for initial preview delete). Other custom action buttons can be set for initial preview thumbnails as well. \r\n12. Ensure plugin is still lean in size and optimized for performance inspite of the above features by optimally utilizing HTML5 & jquery features only.\r\n13. Automatically refresh preview with content from server as soon as an ajax upload finishes.\r\n14. Ability to resize images has been added since release v4.2.7. The browser must support HTML5 canvas for resizing images. In addition, this release includes various enhancements for upload management without a preview.\r\n\r\n> NOTE: Drag and Drop zone functionality, selectively appending or deleting files, and upload indicator with progress are ONLY AVAILABLE if you use AJAX BASED uploads (by setting `uploadUrl`).\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\nView the [plugin documentation](http://plugins.krajee.com/file-input) and [plugin demos](http://plugins.krajee.com/file-input/demo) at Krajee JQuery plugins. \r\n\r\n## Pre-requisites  \r\n\r\n1. [Bootstrap 3.x](http://getbootstrap.com/)\r\n2. Latest [JQuery](http://jquery.com/)\r\n3. Most modern browsers supporting HTML5 (inputs and FileReader API) including CSS3 & JQuery. For Internet Explorer, one must use IE versions 10 and above. IE9 and below will work as a normal file input, and will not support multiple file selection or the HTML 5 FileReader API.\r\n4. With release 4.0, AJAX uploads are supported. AJAX uploads require that the browser support HTML5 FormData and XHR2 (XMLHttpRequest 2). Most modern browsers support FormData and XHR2. The plugin will automatically degrade to normal form based submission for browsers not supporting AJAX uploads.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Using Bower\r\nYou can use the `bower` package manager to install. Run:\r\n\r\n    bower install bootstrap-fileinput\r\n\r\n### Using Composer\r\nYou can use the `composer` package manager to install. Either run:\r\n\r\n    $ php composer.phar require kartik-v/bootstrap-fileinput \"@dev\"\r\n\r\nor add:\r\n\r\n    \"kartik-v/bootstrap-fileinput\": \"@dev\"\r\n\r\nto your composer.json file\r\n\r\n### Manual Install\r\n\r\nYou can also manually install the plugin easily to your project. Just download the source [ZIP](https://github.com/kartik-v/bootstrap-fileinput/zipball/master) or [TAR ball](https://github.com/kartik-v/bootstrap-fileinput/tarball/master) and extract the plugin assets (css and js folders) into your project.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nStep 1: Load the following assets in your header. \r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n<link href=\"path/to/css/fileinput.min.css\" media=\"all\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" />\r\n<script src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n<!-- canvas-to-blob.min.js is only needed if you wish to resize images before upload.\r\n     This must be loaded before fileinput.min.js -->\r\n<script src=\"path/to/js/plugins/canvas-to-blob.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"path/to/js/fileinput.min.js\"></script>\r\n<!-- bootstrap.js below is only needed if you wish to the feature of viewing details\r\n     of text file preview via modal dialog -->\r\n<script src=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n<!-- optionally if you need translation for your language then include \r\n    locale file as mentioned below -->\r\n<script src=\"path/to/js/fileinput_locale_<lang>.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you noticed, you need to load the `jquery.min.js` and `bootstrap.min.css` in addition to the `fileinput.min.css` and `fileinput.min.js`. The locale file `fileinput_locale_<lang>.js` can be optionally included for translating for your language if needed.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The `canvas-to-blob.min.js` file is the source for the [JavaScript-Canvas-to-Blob plugin by blueimp](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Canvas-to-Blob). It is required to be loaded before `fileinput.js` if you wish to use the image resize feature of the **bootstrap-fileinput** plugin. For ease of access, the plugin source for JavaScript-Canvas-to-Blob is included in the `js/plugins` folder of this project repository.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Initialize the plugin on your page. For example,\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// initialize with defaults\r\n$(\"#input-id\").fileinput();\r\n\r\n// with plugin options\r\n$(\"#input-id\").fileinput({'showUpload':false, 'previewFileType':'any'});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `#input-id` is the identifier for the input (e.g. `type = file`) on your page, which is hidden automatically by the plugin. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can directly call the plugin options by setting data attributes to your input field.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<input id=\"input-id\" type=\"file\" class=\"file\" data-preview-file-type=\"text\" >\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Translations\r\n\r\nAs shown in the installation section, translations are now enabled with release 4.1.8. You can load a locale file `/fileinput_locale_<lang>.js` after the core `fileinput.min.js` file, where `<lang>` is the language code (e.g. `de`, `fr` etc.). If  locale file does not exist, you can submit a translation for the new language via a [new pull request to add to this folder](https://github.com/kartik-v/bootstrap-fileinput/tree/master/js). Use the [sample locale file](https://github.com/kartik-v/bootstrap-fileinput/tree/master/js/fileinput_locale_LANG.js) to copy and create a translation configuration for your own language.\r\n\r\n## Plugin Options\r\nThe plugin supports these following options:\r\n\r\n### language\r\n_string_ language configuration for the plugin to enable the plugin to display messages for your locale (you must set the ISO code for the language). You can have multiple language widgets on the same page. The locale JS file for the language code must be defined as mentioned in the translations section. The file must be loaded after `fileinput.js`.\r\n\r\n### showCaption\r\n_boolean_ whether to display the file caption. Defaults to `true`.\r\n\r\n### showPreview\r\n_boolean_ whether to display the file preview. Defaults to `true`.\r\n\r\n### showRemove\r\n_boolean_ whether to display the file remove/clear button. Defaults to `true`.\r\n\r\n### showUpload\r\n_boolean_ whether to display the file upload button. Defaults to `true`. This will default to a form submit button, unless the uploadUrl is specified.\r\n\r\n### showCancel\r\n_boolean_ whether to display the file upload cancel button. Defaults to `true`. This will be only enabled and displayed when an AJAX upload is in process.\r\n\r\n### showUploadedThumbs\r\n_boolean_ whether to persist display of the uploaded file thumbnails in the preview window (for ajax uploads) until the remove/clear button is pressed. Defaults to `true`.  When set to `false`, a next batch of files selected for upload will clear these thumbnails from preview.\r\n\r\n### autoReplace\r\n_boolean_ whether to automatically replace the files in the preview after the `maxFileCount` limit is reached and a new set of file(s) is/are selected. This will only work if a valid  `maxFileCount` is set. Defaults to `false`.\r\n\r\n### captionClass\r\n_string_ any additional CSS class to append to the caption container.\r\n\r\n### previewClass\r\n_string_ any additional CSS class to append to the preview container.\r\n\r\n### mainClass\r\n_string_ any additional CSS class to append to the main plugin container.\r\n\r\n### initialDelimiter\r\n_string_, the delimiter to be used to allow passing multiple content delimited as a string to `initialPreview`. Defaults to `'*$$*'`.\r\n\r\n### initialPreview\r\n_string | array_ the initial preview content to be displayed. You can pass the minimal HTML markup for displaying your image, text, or file. \r\nIf set as a string, this will display a single file in the initial preview if there is no delimiter. You can set a delimiter (as defined \r\nin `initialDelimiter`) to show multiple files in initial preview.  If set as an array, it will display all files in the array as an \r\ninitial preview (useful for multiple file upload scenarios).\r\n\r\nThe following CSS classes will need to be added for displaying each file type as per the plugin style theme:\r\n\r\n- **image files:** Include CSS class `file-preview-image`\r\n- **text files:** Include CSS class `file-preview-text`\r\n- **other files:** Include CSS class `file-preview-other`\r\n\r\nExamples of how you can setup various files for initial preview:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// for image files\r\ninitialPreview: [\r\n    \"<img src='/images/desert.jpg' class='file-preview-image' alt='Desert' title='Desert'>\",\r\n    \"<img src='/images/jellyfish.jpg' class='file-preview-image' alt='Jelly Fish' title='Jelly Fish'>\",\r\n],\r\n\r\n// for text files\r\ninitialPreview: \"<div class='file-preview-text' title='NOTES.txt'>\" +\r\n    \"This is the sample text file content upto wrapTextLength of 250 characters\" +\r\n    \"<span class='wrap-indicator' onclick='$(\\\"#show-detailed-text\\\").modal(\\\"show\\\")' title='NOTES.txt'>[…]</span>\" +\r\n    \"</div>\"\r\n\r\n// for other files    \r\ninitialPreview: \"<div class='file-preview-text'>\" + \r\n    \"<h2><i class='glyphicon glyphicon-file'></i></h2>\" +\r\n    \"Filename.xlsx\" + \"</div>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### initialPreviewCount\r\n_int_, the count of initial preview items that will be added to the count of files selected in preview. This is applicable when displaying\r\nthe right caption, when `overwriteInitial` is set to `false`.\r\n\r\n### initialPreviewDelimiter\r\n_string_, the delimiter to be used for splitting the initial preview content as individual file thumbnails (applicable only if `initialPreview` is passed as a _string_ instead of _array_). Defaults to `*$$*`.\r\n\r\n### initialPreviewConfig\r\n_array_, the configuration for setting up important properties for each `initialPreview` item (that is setup as part of `initialPreview`). Each element in the array should be an object/associative array consisting of the following keys:\r\n\r\n    - `caption`: _string_, the caption or filename to display for each initial preview item content.\r\n    - `width`: _string_, the CSS width of the image/content displayed.\r\n    - `url`: _string_, the URL for deleting the image/content in the initial preview via AJAX post response. This will default to `deleteUrl` if not set.\r\n    - `key`: _string|object_, the key that will be passed as data to the `url` via AJAX POST.\r\n    - `frameClass`: _string_, the additional frame css class to set for the file's thumbnail frame.\r\n    - `frameAttr`: _object_, the HTML attribute settings (set as key:value pairs) for the thumbnail frame.\r\n    - `extra`: _object|function_, the extra data that will be passed as data to the initial preview delete url/AJAX server call via POST. This will default to `deleteExtraData` if not set.\r\n\r\nAn example configuration of `initialPreviewConfig` (for the previously set `initialPreviewContent`) can be:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// setup initial preview with data keys \r\ninitialPreview: [\r\n    \"<img src='/images/desert.jpg' class='file-preview-image' alt='Desert' title='Desert'>\",\r\n    \"<img src='/images/jellyfish.jpg' class='file-preview-image' alt='Jelly Fish' title='Jelly Fish'>\",\r\n],\r\n// initial preview configuration\r\ninitialPreviewConfig: [\r\n    {\r\n        caption: 'desert.jpg', \r\n        width: '120px', \r\n        url: '/localhost/avatar/delete', \r\n        key: 100, \r\n        extra: {id: 100}\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        caption: 'jellyfish.jpg', \r\n        width: '120px', \r\n        url: '/localhost/avatar/delete', \r\n        key: 101, \r\n        frameClass: 'my-custom-frame-css',\r\n        frameAttr: {\r\n            style: 'height:80px',\r\n            title: 'My Custom Title',\r\n        },\r\n        extra: function() { \r\n            return {id: $(\"#id\").val()};\r\n        },\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Note: The ajax delete action will send the following data to server via POST:\r\n- `key`: the key setting as setup in `initialPreviewConfig['key']`\r\n- any other extra data as `key: value` pairs passed either via `initialPreviewConfig['extra']` OR `deleteExtraData` format if former is not set.\r\n\r\n### initialPreviewShowDelete\r\n_bool_, whether the delete button will be displayed for each thumbnail that has been created with `initialPreview`.\r\n\r\n### previewThumbTags\r\n_array_, this will be a list of tags used in thumbnail templates that will be replaced dynamically within the thumbnail markup, when the thumbnail is rendered. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// change thumbnail footer template\r\nlayoutTemplates.footer = '<div class=\"file-thumbnail-footer\">\\n' +\r\n'    <div class=\"file-caption-name\">{caption}</div>\\n' +\r\n'    {CUSTOM_TAG_NEW}\\n' +\r\n'    {CUSTOM_TAG_INIT}\\n' +\r\n'    {actions}\\n' +\r\n'</div>';\r\n\r\n// set preview template tags\r\npreviewThumbTags = {\r\n    '{CUSTOM_TAG_NEW}': '<span class=\"custom-css\">CUSTOM MARKUP</span>',\r\n    '{CUSTOM_TAG_INIT}': '&nbsp;'\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### initialPreviewThumbTags\r\n_array_, this is an extension of `previewThumbTags` specifically for initial preview content - but will be configured as an array of objects corresponding to each initial preview thumbnail. The initial preview thumbnails set via `initialPreview` will read this configuration for replacing tags. Extending example above:\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// change thumbnail footer template\r\nlayoutTemplates.footer = '<div class=\"file-thumbnail-footer\">\\n' +\r\n'    <div class=\"file-caption-name\">{caption}</div>\\n' +\r\n'    {CUSTOM_TAG_NEW}\\n' +\r\n'    {CUSTOM_TAG_INIT}\\n' +\r\n'    {actions}\\n' +\r\n'</div>';\r\n\r\n// setup initial preview with data keys \r\ninitialPreview: [\r\n    \"<img src='/images/desert.jpg' class='file-preview-image' alt='Desert' title='Desert'>\",\r\n    \"<img src='/images/jellyfish.jpg' class='file-preview-image' alt='Jelly Fish' title='Jelly Fish'>\",\r\n],\r\n\r\n// set initial preview template tags\r\ninitialPreviewThumbTags = {\r\n    '{CUSTOM_TAG_NEW}': '&nbsp;',\r\n    '{CUSTOM_TAG_INIT}': '<span class=\"custom-css\">CUSTOM MARKUP</span>'\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### deleteExtraData\r\n_object | function_ the extra data that will be passed as data to the initial preview delete url/AJAX server call via POST. This will be overridden by the `initialPreviewConfig['extra']` property. This can be setup either as an object (associative array of keys and values) or as a function callback. As an object, it can be set for example as:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n {id: 100, value: '100 Details'}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a function callback, it can be setup for example as:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction() {\r\n    var obj = {};\r\n    $('.your-form-class').find('input').each(function() {\r\n        var id = $(this).attr('id'), val = $(this).val();\r\n        obj[id] = val;\r\n    });\r\n    return obj;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### deleteUrl\r\n_object | function_ the URL for deleting the image/content in the initial preview via AJAX post response. This will be overridden by the `initialPreviewConfig['url']` property.\r\n\r\n### initialCaption\r\n_string_ the initial preview caption text to be displayed. If you do not set a value here and `initialPreview` is set to \r\n`true` this will default to `\"{preview-file-count} files selected\"`, where `{preview-file-count}` is the count of the \r\nfiles passed in `initialPreview`.\r\n\r\n### overwriteInitial\r\n_boolean_ whether you wish to overwrite the initial preview content and caption setup. This defaults to `true`, whereby, any `initialPreview` content set \r\nwill be overwritten, when new file is uploaded or when files are cleared. Setting it to `false` will help displaying a saved image or file from database always - \r\nuseful especially when using the `multiple` file upload feature.\r\n \r\n### layoutTemplates\r\n\r\n_object_ the templates configuration for rendering each part of the layout. You can set the following templates to control the widget layout:\r\n\r\n- `main1`: the template for rendering the widget with caption.\r\n- `main2`: the template for rendering the widget without caption.\r\n- `preview`: the template for rendering the preview.\r\n- `icon`: the icon to render before the caption text.\r\n- `caption`: the template for rendering the caption.\r\n- `modal`: the template for rendering the modal (for text file preview zooming).\r\n- `progress`: the template for the progress bar when upload is in progress (for batch/mass uploads and within each preview thumbnail for async/single uploads). The upload progress bar when displayed within each thumbnail will be wrapped inside a container having a CSS class of `file-thumb-progress`. The following tags will be parsed and replaced automatically: \r\n    - `{percent}`: will be replaced with the upload progress percentage.\r\n- `footer`: the template for the footer section of each file preview thumbnail. The following tags will be parsed and replaced automatically:\r\n    - `{actions}`: will be replaced with the output of the `actions` template.\r\n- `actions`: the template for the file action buttons to be displayed within the thumbnail `footer`. The following tags will be parsed and replaced automatically:\r\n    - `{upload}`: will be replaced with the output of the `actionUpload` template.\r\n    - `{delete}`: will be replaced with the output of the `actionDelete` template.\r\n- `actionDelete`: the template for the file delete action button within the thumbnail `footer`. The following tags will be parsed and replaced automatically:\r\n    - `{removeClass}`: the css class for the remove button. Will be replaced with the `removeClass` set within `fileActionSettings`.\r\n    - `{removeIcon}`: the icon for the remove button. Will be replaced with the `removeIcon` set within `fileActionSettings`.\r\n    - `{removeTitle}`: the title to display on hover for the remove button. Will be replaced with the `removeTitle` set within `fileActionSettings`.\r\n    - `{dataUrl}`: the URL for deleting the file thumbnail for `initialPreview` content only. Will be replaced with the `url` set within `initialPreviewConfig`.\r\n    - `{dataKey}`: the key (additional data) that will be passed to the URL above via POST to the AJAX call. Will be replaced with the `key` set within `initialPreviewConfig`.\r\n- `actionUpload`: the template for the file upload action button within the thumbnail `footer`.\r\n    - `{uploadClass}`: the css class for the upload button. Will be replaced with the `uploadClass` set within `fileActionSettings`.\r\n    - `{uploadIcon}`: the icon for the upload button. Will be replaced with the `uploadIcon` set within `fileActionSettings`.\r\n    - `{uploadTitle}`: the title to display on hover for the upload button. Will be replaced with the `uploadTitle` set within `fileActionSettings`.\r\n\r\nThe `main1` and `main2` templates would automatically parse the following tags for replacement:\r\n\r\n- `{class}`: the CSS class as set in the `mainClass` property.\r\n- `{close}`: will be replaced with the close (cross) icon (by default on top right of the preview window). The layout template to control this markup is `layoutTemplates.close`.\r\n- `{preview}`: the content parsed by the `previewTemplate` and will be displayed only if `showPreview` is `true`.\r\n- `{caption}`: the content parsed by the `captionTemplate` and will be displayed only if `showCaption` is `true`.\r\n- `{remove}`: the file remove/clear button and will be displayed only if `showRemove` is `true`.\r\n- `{upload}`: the file upload button and will be displayed only if `showUpload` is `true`.\r\n- `{cancel}`: the file upload cancel button that will be displayed when AJAX upload is in process to abort the AJAX upload.\r\n- `{browse}`: the main file browse button to select your files for input.\r\n\r\nThe `preview` and `caption` templates can understand the following special tags which will be replaced:\r\n\r\n- `{class}`: the CSS class as set in the `mainClass`, `captionClass` or `previewClass` properties.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the `progress` layout template can understand the following special tags which will be replaced:\r\n\r\n- `{class}`: the CSS class as set in the `progressClass` or `progressCompleteClass` properties.\r\n\r\nThe `layoutTemplates` if not set will default to:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    main1: '{preview}\\n' +\r\n        '<div class=\"kv-upload-progress hide\"></div>\\n' +\r\n        '<div class=\"input-group {class}\">\\n' +\r\n        '   {caption}\\n' +\r\n        '   <div class=\"input-group-btn\">\\n' +\r\n        '       {remove}\\n' +\r\n        '       {cancel}\\n' +\r\n        '       {upload}\\n' +\r\n        '       {browse}\\n' +\r\n        '   </div>\\n' +\r\n        '</div>',\r\n    main2: '{preview}\\n<div class=\"kv-upload-progress hide\"></div>\\n{remove}\\n{cancel}\\n{upload}\\n{browse}\\n',\r\n    preview: '<div class=\"file-preview {class}\">\\n' +\r\n        '    {close}\\n' +\r\n        '    <div class=\"{dropClass}\">\\n' +\r\n        '    <div class=\"file-preview-thumbnails\">\\n' +\r\n        '    </div>\\n' +\r\n        '    <div class=\"clearfix\"></div>' +\r\n        '    <div class=\"file-preview-status text-center text-success\"></div>\\n' +\r\n        '    <div class=\"kv-fileinput-error\"></div>\\n' +\r\n        '    </div>\\n' +\r\n        '</div>',\r\n    close: '<div class=\"close fileinput-remove\">&times;</div>',\r\n    icon: '<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-file kv-caption-icon\"></span>',\r\n    caption: '<div tabindex=\"-1\" class=\"form-control file-caption {class}\">\\n' +\r\n        '   <span class=\"file-caption-ellipsis\">&hellip;</span>\\n' +\r\n        '   <div class=\"file-caption-name\"></div>\\n' +\r\n        '</div>',\r\n    btnDefault: '<button type=\"{type}\" tabindex=\"500\" title=\"{title}\" class=\"{css}\"{status}>{icon}{label}</button>',\r\n    btnLink: '<a href=\"{href}\" tabindex=\"500\" title=\"{title}\" class=\"{css}\"{status}>{icon}{label}</a>',\r\n    btnBrowse: '<div tabindex=\"500\" class=\"{css}\"{status}>{icon}{label}</div>',\r\n    modal: '<div id=\"{id}\" class=\"modal fade\">\\n' +\r\n        '  <div class=\"modal-dialog modal-lg\">\\n' +\r\n        '    <div class=\"modal-content\">\\n' +\r\n        '      <div class=\"modal-header\">\\n' +\r\n        '        <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">&times;</button>\\n' +\r\n        '        <h3 class=\"modal-title\">{heading} <small>{title}</small></h3>\\n' +\r\n        '      </div>\\n' +\r\n        '      <div class=\"modal-body\">\\n' +\r\n        '        <textarea class=\"form-control\" style=\"font-family:Monaco,Consolas,monospace;

The following file types are recognized:\r\n\r\n- `image`: the preview template for image files.\r\n- `text`: the  preview template for text files.\r\n- `html`: the preview template for html files.\r\n- `video`: the preview template for video files (supported by HTML 5 video tag).\r\n- `audio`: the preview template for audio files (supported by HTML 5 audio tag).\r\n- `flash`: the preview template for flash files (supported currently on webkit browsers).\r\n- `object`: the preview template for all other files - by default treated as object. To disable this behavior, configure the `allowedPreviewTypes` property.\r\n- `generic`: this template is used ONLY for rendering the `initialPreview` markup content passed directly as a raw format. \r\n\r\nThe following tags will be parsed and replaced in each of the templates:\r\n\r\n- `{previewId}`: will be replaced with the generated identifier for the preview frame container.\r\n- `{data}`: will be replaced with the data source for each preview type.\r\n- `{width}`: will be replaced with the width for the file type as set in `previewSettings`.\r\n- `{height}`: will be replaced with the height for the file type as set in `previewSettings`.\r\n- `{caption}`: will be replaced with the file name.\r\n- `{type}`: will be replaced with the file type.\r\n- `{content}`: this is applicable only for the `generic` template. It will be replaced with the raw HTML markup as set in `initialPreview`. None of \r\n   the above tags will be parsed for the `generic` template.\r\n- `{dialog}`: currently applicable only for text file previews. Will be replaced with the JS code to launch the modal dialog.\r\n- `{zoomTitle}`: currently applicable only for text file previews. This will be replaced with the `msgZoomTitle` property. This is the title that is displayed on hover of the zoom button (which on clicking will display the text file).\r\n- `{zoomInd}`: currently applicable only for text file previews. This will be replaced with the `zoomIndicator` property. This is the title that is displayed on hover of the zoom button (which on clicking will display the text file).\r\n- `{heading}`: currently applicable only for text file previews. This represents the modal dialog heading title. This will be replaced with the `msgZoomModalHeading` property. \r\n\r\nThe following templates will be used in rendering the main buttons for upload, remove, cancel, and browse.\r\n\r\n- `btnDefault`: The template for upload, remove, and cancel buttons\r\n- `btnLink`: The template for upload button when used with ajax (i.e. when `uploadUrl` is set).\r\n- `btnBrowse`: The template for the browse button.\r\n\r\nThe following tags will be parsed and auto replaced in the above button templates:\r\n\r\n- `{type}`: the HTML button type, defaults to `button` for most buttons and `submit` for form based uploads\r\n- `{title}`: the title to display on button hover.\r\n- `{css}`: the CSS class for the button. This is derived from settings for `uploadClass` or `removeClass` or `cancelClass` or `browseClass`.\r\n- `{status}`: the disabled status for the button if available (else will be blank).\r\n- `{icon}`: the button icon as identified by `uploadIcon` or `removeIcon` or `cancelIcon` or `browseIcon`.\r\n- `{label}`: the button label as identified by `uploadLabel` or `removeLabel` or `cancelLabel` or `browseLabel`.\r\n- `{href}`: applicable only for Upload button for ajax uploads and will be replaced with the `uploadUrl` property.\r\n\r\nThe `previewTemplates` if not set will default to:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    generic: '<div class=\"file-preview-frame\" id=\"{previewId}\" data-fileindex=\"{fileindex}\">\\n' +\r\n        '   {content}\\n' +\r\n        '   {footer}\\n'

`{previewFileIcon}`: corresponds to the [previewFileIcon](#option-previewfileicon) property.\r\n- `{previewFileIconClass}`: corresponds to the [previewFileIconClass](#option-previewfileiconclass) property.\r\n\r\n### allowedFileTypes\r\n\r\n_array_ the list of allowed file types for upload. This by default is set to null which means the plugin supports all file types for upload. If an \r\ninvalid file type is found, then a validation error message as set in `msgInvalidFileType` will be raised. The following types as set in `fileTypeSettings` \r\nare available for setup. \r\n\r\n```js\r\n['image', 'html', 'text', 'video', 'audio', 'flash', 'object']\r\n```\r\n\r\n### allowedFileExtensions\r\n\r\n_array_ the list of allowed file extensions for upload. This by default is set to null which means the plugin supports all file extensions for upload. If an \r\ninvalid file extension is found, then a validation error message as set in `msgInvalidFileExtension` will be raised. An example of setting this could be:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n['jpg', 'gif', 'png', 'txt']\r\n```\r\n\r\n> NOTE: You need to be careful in case you are setting both `allowedFileTypes` and `allowedFileExtensions`. In this case, the `allowedFileTypes` property \r\nis validated first and generally precedes the `allowedFileExtensions` setting (and the latter validation maybe skipped).\r\n\r\n### allowedPreviewTypes\r\n\r\n_array_ the list of allowed preview types for your widget. This by default supports all file types for preview. The plugin by default treats each\r\nfile as an object if it does not match any of the previous types. To disable this behavior, you can remove `object` from the list of `allowedPreviewTypes`\r\nOR fine tune it through `allowedPreviewMimeTypes`. To disable content preview for all file-types and show the `previewIcon` instead as a thumbnail, set this to null, empty, or `false`.\r\n\r\nThis is by default setup as following:\r\n```js\r\n['image', 'html', 'text', 'video', 'audio', 'flash', 'object']\r\n```\r\n\r\n### allowedPreviewMimeTypes\r\n\r\n_array_ the list of allowed mime types for preview. This is set to null by default which means all possible mime types are allowed. This setting works in combination with `allowedPreviewTypes` to filter only the needed file types allowed for preview. You can check this [list of allowed mime types](http://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/mime-types-complete-list/) to add to this list if needed.\r\n\r\n### defaultPreviewContent\r\n\r\n_string_ the default content / markup to show by default in the preview window whenever the files are cleared or the input is cleared. This can be useful for use cases like showing the default user profile picture or profile image before upload to overwrite. This is a bit different from `initialPreview` in the sense, that the `initialPreview` content will always be displayed unless it is deleted or overwritten based on `overwriteInitial`. The `defaultPreviewContent` on the other hand will only be shown ONLY on initialization OR whenever you clear the preview. At other times when files have been selected this will be overwritten temporarily until file(s) selected is/are cleared.\r\n\r\n### customLayoutTags\r\n\r\n_object_ the list of additional custom tags that will be replaced in the **layout** templates. This should be an associative array object of `key: value` pairs, where:\r\n\r\n- `key`: _string_, is the tag to be replaced and as a standard is recommended to be enclosed between braces.\r\n- `value`: _string|function_, is the value that will replace the tag key above. This can be setup either as a string or callback function.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// example 1 - tags with value set as string\r\ncustomLayoutTags: {\r\n    '{tagA}': '<span class=\"label label-default\">Tag A</span>',\r\n    '{tagB}': 'Tag B',\r\n}\r\n\r\n// example 2 - tags with value set as callback\r\ncustomLayoutTags: {\r\n    '{tagC}': function() {\r\n        return $(\"#element-id\").val();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### customPreviewTags\r\n\r\n_object_ the list of additional custom tags that will be replaced in the **preview** templates. This should be an associative array object of `key: value` pairs, where:\r\n\r\n- `key`: _string_, is the tag to be replaced and as a standard is recommended to be enclosed between braces.\r\n- `value`: _string|function_, is the value that will replace the tag key above. This can be setup either as a string or callback function.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// example 1 - tags with value set as string\r\ncustomPreviewTags: {\r\n    '{tagA}': '<span class=\"label label-default\">Tag A</span>',\r\n    '{tagB}': 'Tag B',\r\n}\r\n\r\n// example 2 - tags with value set as callback\r\ncustomPreviewTags: {\r\n    '{tagC}': function() {\r\n        return $(\"#element-id\").val();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### previewSettings\r\n\r\n_object_ the format settings (width and height) for rendering each preview file type. This is by default setup as following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    image: {width: \"auto\", height: \"160px\"},\r\n    html: {width: \"213px\", height: \"160px\"},\r\n    text: {width: \"160px\", height: \"136px\"},\r\n    video: {width: \"213px\", height: \"160px\"},\r\n    audio: {width: \"213px\", height: \"80px\"},\r\n    flash: {width: \"213px\", height: \"160px\"},\r\n    object: {width: \"160px\", height: \"160px\"},\r\n    other: {width: \"160px\", height: \"160px\"}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### fileTypeSettings\r\n\r\n_object_ the settings to validate and identify each file type when a file is selected for upload. This is a list of callbacks, which accepts the file mime type and file name as a parameter.\r\nThis is by default setup as following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// vType: is the file mime type\r\n// vName: is the file name\r\n{\r\n\timage: function(vType, vName) {\r\n\t\treturn (typeof vType !== \"undefined\") ? vType.match('image.*') : vName.match(/\\.(gif|png|jpe?g)$/i);\r\n\t},\r\n\thtml: function(vType, vName) {\r\n\t\treturn (typeof vType !== \"undefined\") ? vType == 'text/html' : vName.match(/\\.(htm|html)$/i);\r\n\t},\r\n\ttext: function(vType, vName) {\r\n\t\treturn typeof vType !== \"undefined\" && vType.match('text.*') || vName.match(/\\.(txt|md|csv|nfo|php|ini)$/i);\r\n\t},\r\n\tvideo: function (vType, vName) {\r\n\t\treturn typeof vType !== \"undefined\" && vType.match(/\\.video\\/(ogg|mp4|webm)$/i) || vName.match(/\\.(og?|mp4|webm)$/i);\r\n\t},\r\n\taudio: function (vType, vName) {\r\n\t\treturn typeof vType !== \"undefined\" && vType.match(/\\.audio\\/(ogg|mp3|wav)$/i) || vName.match(/\\.(ogg|mp3|wav)$/i);\r\n\t},\r\n\tflash: function (vType, vName) {\r\n\t\treturn typeof vType !== \"undefined\" && vType == 'application/x-shockwave-flash' || vName.match(/\\.(swf)$/i);\r\n\t},\r\n\tobject: function (vType, vName) {\r\n\t\treturn true;\r\n\t},\r\n\tother: function (vType, vName) {\r\n\t\treturn true;\r\n\t},\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### previewFileIcon\r\n_string_ the default icon to be shown in each preview file thumbnail when an unreadable file type for preview is detected. Defaults to `<i class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-file\"></i>`.\r\n\r\n### previewFileIconClass\r\n_string_ the CSS class to be applied to the preview file icon container. Defaults to `file-icon-4x`.\r\n\r\n### previewFileIconSettings\r\n_object_ the preview icon markup settings for each file extension (type). You need to set this as `key: value` pairs, where the `key` corresponds to a file extension (e.g. `doc`, `docx`, `xls` etc.), and the `value` corresponds to the markup of the icon to be rendered. If this is not set OR a file extension is not set here, the preview will default to [previewFileIcon](#option-previewfileicon). Note that displaying the icons instead of file content is controlled via [allowedPreviewTypes](#option-allowedpreviewtypes) and [allowedPreviewMimeTypes](#option-allowedpreviewmimetypes).\r\n\r\nYou can setup `previewFileIconSettings` as shown below:\r\n\r\n```js\r\npreviewFileIconSettings: {\r\n    'doc': '<i class=\"fa fa-file-word-o text-primary\"></i>',\r\n    'xls': '<i class=\"fa fa-file-excel-o text-success\"></i>',\r\n    'ppt': '<i class=\"fa fa-file-powerpoint-o text-danger\"></i>',\r\n    'jpg': '<i class=\"fa fa-file-photo-o text-warning\"></i>',\r\n    'pdf': '<i class=\"fa fa-file-pdf-o text-danger\"></i>',\r\n    'zip': '<i class=\"fa fa-file-archive-o text-muted\"></i>',\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### previewFileExtSettings\r\n_object_ the extensions to be auto derived for each file extension (type). This is useful if you want to set the same icon for multiple file extension types. You need to set this as `key: value` pairs, where the `key` corresponds to a file extension as set in [previewFileIconSettings](#option-previewfileiconsettings) (e.g. `doc`, `docx`, `xls` etc.). The `value` will be a function callback that accepts the following parameter:\r\n\r\n- `ext`: _string_, the file extension (without the `.` [dot]) of the file currently selected in the preview \r\n\r\nYou can configure the callback to match the set of file extensions (via regex or similar) for each `key` and return a boolean output if the file extension matches. \r\n\r\nFor example, you can setup `previewFileExtSettings` as shown below:\r\n\r\n```js\r\npreviewFileExtSettings: {\r\n    'doc': function(ext) {\r\n        return ext.match(/(doc|docx)$/i);\r\n    },\r\n    'xls': function(ext) {\r\n        return ext.match(/(xls|xlsx)$/i);\r\n    },\r\n    'ppt': function(ext) {\r\n        return ext.match(/(ppt|pptx)$/i);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### browseLabel\r\n_string_ the label to display for the file picker/browse button.

Defaults to `<i class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-upload\"></i> &nbsp;`.\r\n\r\n### uploadClass\r\n_string_ the CSS class for the file upload button. Defaults to `btn btn-default`.\r\n\r\n### uploadTitle\r\n_string_ the title to display on hover for the file remove button. Defaults to `Upload selected files`.\r\n\r\n### uploadUrl\r\n_string_ the URL for the upload processing action (typically for ajax based processing). Defaults to `null`. If this is not set or `null`, then the upload button action will default to form submission. NOTE: This is MANDATORY if you want to use advanced features like drag & drop, append/remove files, selectively upload files via ajax etc.\r\n\r\n### uploadAsync\r\n_bool_ whether the batch upload of multiple files will be asynchronous/in parallel. Defaults to `true`.\r\n\r\n### uploadExtraData\r\n_object | function_ the extra data that will be passed as data to the url/AJAX server call via POST. This can be setup either as an object (associative array of keys and values) or as a function callback. As an object, it can be set for example as:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n {id: 100, value: '100 Details'}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a function callback, the `uploadExtraData` can be setup as shown below. Note that for uploading individual file via thumbnail, the callback can also receive the thumbnail `previewId` and `index` as parameters. These are described below:\r\n\r\n- `previewId`: the identifier for the preview file container (only available when uploading each thumbnail file)\r\n- `index`: the zero-based sequential index of the loaded file in the preview list (only available when uploading each thumbnail file)\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// previewId and index is only available for individual file upload via the thumbnail\r\nfunction (previewId, index) {\r\n    var obj = {};\r\n    $('.your-form-class').find('input').each(function() {\r\n        var id = $(this).attr('id'), val = $(this).val();\r\n        obj[id] = val;\r\n    });\r\n    return obj;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### minImageWidth\r\n_int_ the minimum allowed image width in `px` if you are uploading image files. Defaults to `null` which means no limit on image width.\r\n\r\n### minImageHeight\r\n_int_ the minimum allowed image height in `px` if you are uploading image files. Defaults to `null` which means no limit on image height.\r\n\r\n### maxImageWidth\r\n_int_ the maximum allowed image width in `px` if you are uploading image files. Defaults to `null` which means no limit on image width. Note that if you set `resizeImage` property to `true`, then the entire image will be resized within this width.\r\n\r\n### maxImageHeight\r\n_int_ the maximum allowed image height in `px` if you are uploading image files. Defaults to `null` which means no limit on image height. Note that if you set `resizeImage` property to `true`, then the entire image will be resized within this height.\r\n\r\n### resizeImage\r\n_bool_ whether to add ability to resize uploaded images. Defaults to `false`. Note that resizing images requires HTML5 canvas support which is supported on most modern browsers. In addition, you must include the [JavaScript-Canvas-to-Blob plugin by blueimp](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Canvas-to-Blob) by including `canvas-to-blob.js` in your application. This JS file must be loaded before `fileinput.js` on the page. The JavaScript-Canvas-to-Blob source files are available in `js/plugins` folder of bootstrap-fileinput project page. The `canvas-to-blob.js` plugin is a polyfill for `canvas.toBlob` method and is needed for allowing the resized image files via HTML5 canvas to be returned as a blob. \r\n\r\n### resizePreference\r\n_string_ preference to resize the image based on `width` or `height`. Defaults to `width`. This property is parsed only when `resizeImage` is `true`. If set to `width`, the `maxImageWidth` property is first tested and if image size is greater than this, then the image is resized to `maxImageWidth`. The image `height` is resized and adjusted in the same ratio as `width`. In case, the image width is already less than `maxImageWidth` then the `maxImageHeight` property is used to resize and width is adjusted in same ratio. \r\n\r\nThis will behave conversely, when `resizePreference` is set to `height` - the `maxImageHeight` will be first tested against image height and then the rest of steps will be similarly parsed with preference given to `height` instead of `width` as before. For example:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n// Example for resizePreference = 'width'\r\n// - will resize image width to 200 px if image width is > 200 px\r\n// - will resize image height to 200 px if image width is < 200 px and\r\n//   image height is > 200 px\r\n// if none of the above image will be returned as is\r\n$('#file-input').fileinput({\r\n    resizeImage: true,\r\n    maxImageWidth: 200,\r\n    maxImageHeight: 200,\r\n    resizePreference: 'width'\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### resizeQuality\r\n_float_ the quality of the resized image. This must be a decimal number between `0.00` to `1.00`. Defaults to `0.92`.\r\n\r\n### resizeDefaultImageType\r\n_string_ the default image mime type of the converted image after resize. Defaults to `image/jpeg`.\r\n\r\n### maxFileSize\r\n_float_ the maximum file size for upload in KB.  If set to `0`, it means size allowed is unlimited. Defaults to `0`.\r\n\r\n### minFileCount\r\n_int_ the minimum number of files allowed for each multiple upload. If set to `0`, it means number of files are optional. Defaults to `0`.\r\n\r\n### maxFileCount\r\n_int_ the maximum number of files allowed for each multiple upload. If set to `0`, it means number of files allowed is unlimited. Defaults to `0`.\r\n\r\n### validateInitialCount\r\n_boolean_ whether to include initial preview file count (server uploaded files) in validating `minFileCount` and `maxFileCount`.

Additional parameters available \r\nare: \r\n\r\n- `file`: the file object instance\r\n- `previewId`: the identifier for the preview file container\r\n- `index`: the zero-based sequential index of the loaded file in the preview list\r\n- `reader`: the FileReader instance if available\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').on('fileloaded', function(event, file, previewId, index, reader) {\r\n    console.log(\"fileloaded\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### filereset\r\nThis event is triggered when the file input is reset to initial value.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').on('filereset', function(event) {\r\n    console.log(\"filereset\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### fileimageloaded\r\nThis event is triggered when each file image is fully loaded in the preview window. This is only applicable for image file previews and if `showPreview` is set to true. Additional parameters available are: \r\n\r\n- `previewId`: the identifier for the preview file container\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').on('fileimageloaded', function(event, previewId) {\r\n    console.log(\"fileimageloaded\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### fileimagesloaded\r\nThis event is triggered when all file images are fully loaded in the preview window. This is only applicable for image file previews and if `showPreview` is set to true. \r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').on('fileimagesloaded', function(event) {\r\n    console.log(\"fileimagesloaded\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### fileimageresized\r\nThis event is triggered when a file image in preview window is resized based on the `resizeImage` and `maxImageWidth`/`maxImageHeight` settings.

Additional parameters available are: \r\n\r\n- `previewId`: the identifier for the preview file container\r\n- `index`: the zero-based sequential index of the loaded file in the preview list\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').on('fileimageresized', function(event, previewId, index) {\r\n    console.log(\"fileimageresized\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### fileimagesresized\r\nThis event is triggered when all file images in preview window are resized based on the `resizeImage` and `maxImageWidth`/`maxImageHeight` settings. This is only applicable for image file previews and if `showPreview` is set to true. \r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').on('fileimagesresized', function(event) {\r\n    console.log(\"fileimagesresized\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### filebrowse\r\nThis event is triggered when the file browse button is clicked to open the file selection dialog.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').on('filebrowse', function(event) {\r\n    console.log(\"File browse triggered.\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### filebatchselected\r\nThis event is triggered after a batch of files are selected and displayed in the preview.\r\nAdditional parameters available are: \r\n\r\n- `files`: the file stack array (or empty object if not available).\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').on('filebatchselected', function(event, files) {\r\n    console.log('File batch selected triggered');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### fileselectnone\r\nThis event is triggered when no files are selected by the user for a repeat selection scenario (i.e. on a file input that already contains previously selected files). This event is better applicable for browsers like Google Chrome, which clear the file input when the file selection dialog is cancelled. For other browsers, this event is typically triggered only when one resets the form or clears file input (using the remove button).\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').on('fileselectnone', function(event) {\r\n    console.log(\"Huh! No files were selected.\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### filelock\r\nThis event is triggered when the upload process is launched by clicking a upload button, and the entire widget is locked (disabled) until upload is getting processed.

This is different than `filepredelete` in the sense, that this is NOT applicable for thumbnails set via `initialPreview`. The additional parameters available with this event are:\r\n\r\n- `previewId`: the identifier of the preview thumbnail container.\r\n- `index`: the zero-based index of the file in the preview container.\r\n\r\n>Note: You can call `event.preventDefault()` or `return false;` to abort the removal process.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').on('filepreremove', function(event, id, index) {\r\n    if (!window.confirm('Do you wish to remove?')) {\r\n        event.preventDefault();\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### fileremoved\r\nThis event is triggered after removal of each thumbnail file in ajax upload mode. This is different than `filedeleted` in the sense, that this is NOT applicable for thumbnails set via `initialPreview`. The additional parameters available with this event are:\r\n\r\n- `previewId`: the identifier of the preview thumbnail container.\r\n- `index`: the zero-based index of the file in the preview container.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').on('fileremoved', function(event, id, index) {\r\n    console.log('fileremoved id = ' + id);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### filepredelete\r\nThis event is triggered before deletion of each thumbnail file in the `initialPreview` content set. Additional parameters available are: \r\n\r\n- `key`: the key passed within `initialPreviewConfig` for the selected file for delete.\r\n- `jqXHR`: the `jQuery XMLHttpRequest` object used for this transaction (if available).\r\n- `data`: the output of `deleteExtraData` object.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').on('filepredelete', function(event, key, jqXHR) {\r\n    console.log('Key = ' + key);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### filedeleted\r\nThis event is triggered after deletion of each thumbnail file in the `initialPreview` content set. Additional parameters available are: \r\n\r\n- `key`: the key passed within `initialPreviewConfig` for the selected file that will be passed as POST data to the `url`.\r\n- `jqXHR`: the `jQuery XMLHttpRequest` object used for this transaction (if available).\r\n- `data`: the output of `deleteExtraData` object.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').on('filedeleted', function(event, key) {\r\n    console.log('Key = ' + key);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').on('fileunlock', function(event, filestack) {\r\n    var fstack = filestack.filter(function(n){ return n != undefined });\r\n    console.log('Files selected - ' + fstack.length);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### filepreajax\r\nThis event is triggered before submission of the upload ajax request.

This functionality is not applicable for the following events.\r\n\r\n- `fileclear`\r\n- `filecleared`\r\n- `filereset`\r\n- `fileerror`\r\n- `fileuploaderror`\r\n- `filebatchuploaderror`\r\n- `filedeleteerror`\r\n- `filefoldererror`\r\n- `filecustomerror`\r\n- `fileuploaded`\r\n- `filebatchuploadcomplete`\r\n- `filebatchuploadsuccess`\r\n\r\nFor all the events other than ones mentioned above, you can set a custom validation error which will be triggered just before upload is initiated.\r\n\r\nThis will enable you to add your additional custom validations to enhance the fileinput to be used for innumerous scenarios. It will allow an ability to return an associative object with any of the fileinput events (except the events above) e.g. `change`, `fileselect`, `filepreupload`, `filebatchpreupload` etc.\r\n\r\nThe object can return the following keys:\r\n\r\n- `message`: _string_, the validation error message to be displayed before upload. If this is set the plugin will automatically abort the upload whenever called and display this as an error message. You can use this property for example to read a file and perform your own custom validation.\r\n- `data`: _object_, an optional associative array of additional data at abort, that you can pass for usage later. \r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n- **STEP 1:** You can trigger an error to abort from `filepreupload`\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$('#input').on('filepreupload', function(event, data, previewId, index, jqXHR) {\r\n    // do your validation and return an error like below\r\n    if (customValidationFailed) {\r\n       return {\r\n           message: 'You are not allowed to do that', \r\n           data: {key1: 'Key 1', detail1: 'Detail 1'}\r\n       };\r\n   }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nThe above abort will be triggered at time of upload for (ajax uploads) OR at form submission (for non-ajax uploads).\r\n\r\n- **STEP 2:** Reading additional data at abort by trapping the `filecustomerror` event\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$('#input').on('filecustomerror', function(event, params) {\r\n   // params.abortData will contain the additional abort data passed\r\n   // params.abortMessage will contain the aborted error message passed\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the above functionality of raising a `filecustomerror` is not supported in the following events:\r\n\r\n- `fileclear`\r\n- `filecleared`\r\n- `filereset`\r\n- `fileerror`\r\n- `fileuploaderror`\r\n- `filebatchuploaderror`\r\n- `filedeleteerror`\r\n- `filecustomerror`\r\n- `fileuploaded`\r\n- `filebatchuploadcomplete`\r\n- `filebatchuploadsuccess`\r\n\r\n### Plugin Methods\r\nThe plugin supports these methods:\r\n\r\n### disable\r\nDisable the file input.\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').fileinput('disable');\r\n```\r\n\r\n### enable\r\nEnable the file input.\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').fileinput('enable');\r\n```\r\n\r\n### reset\r\nReset the file input.\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').fileinput('reset');\r\n```\r\n\r\n### destroy\r\nDestroys the file input.\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').fileinput('destroy');\r\n```\r\n\r\n### refresh\r\nRefreshes the file input plugin based on options provided. You can supply an array of plugin options as a parameter.\r\n```js\r\n// example 1 (disable at runtime)\r\n$('#input-id').attr('disabled', 'disabled');\r\n$('#input-id').fileinput('refresh');\r\n\r\n// example 2 (modify plugin options at runtime)\r\n$('#input-id').fileinput('refresh', {browseLabel: 'Select...', removeLabel: 'Delete'});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### clear\r\nClear the file input and all files from preview.\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').fileinput('clear');\r\n```\r\n\r\n### upload\r\nTrigger ajax upload of the files that are selected. Applicable only if `uploadUrl` is set.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').fileinput('upload');\r\n```\r\n\r\n### cancel\r\nCancel an ongoing ajax upload of the files.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').fileinput('cancel');\r\n```\r\n\r\n### lock\r\nLocks the file input by disabling all actions/buttons except a cancel button to abort ongoing AJAX requests (for ajax uploads only).\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').fileinput('lock');\r\n```\r\n\r\n### unlock\r\nUnlocks and enables the file input back again by reversing the outcome of the `lock` action.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$('#input-id').fileinput('unlock');\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n**bootstrap-fileinput** is released under the BSD 3-Clause License.
